          In lesson 1 we learned that HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or
          <b>block</b> elements - Inline elements end a line of text and wrap new
          text to the next line whereas Block elements form an "invisible box"
          around the content inside of them. Your browser's Developer Tools
          will help you see the underlining source code of any web page. You can
          then drill down to see the different HTML elements and their tree-like
          structure.

      <h3 class="concept-title">The "tree-like structure" of HTML</h3>
      <div class="concept-description line-height">
        <p>
          When programmers talk about the DOM (<b><em>Document Object Model</em>
          </b>), they are referring to the "tree-like structure". In HTML, the
          "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have
          other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like
          a family tree whereby a father has multiple children. His children had
          children who also have children, and so on...
          <br> In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes
          that are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...<br /><br />
          The DOM or "tree-like structure" of HTML looks like this

      <div class="concept-description line-height">
        <p>
          Using the Developer Tool in your browser, when you read an HTML document
          as <em>text</em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and
          down the left or right side of the document. The more indented an
          element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.

      <h3 class="concept-title">Text Editors (for programming)</h3>
      <div class="concept-description line-height">
        <p>
          When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Atom,
          Sublime Text, Bracket etc.). These editors make the programmer's life
          easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a
          closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag and/or autocomplete the
          HTML attribute inside of a tag.
