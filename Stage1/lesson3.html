      <h3 class="concept-title">CSS</h3>
      <div class="concept-description line-height">
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it gives web developers a way
          to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving
          similar HTML elements the same class name and then specifying the
          style rule that should apply to that class.
        </p>
        <p>
          Syntactically, in CSS you first write a selector which defines what
          elements on the page a style rule will apply to then inside the selector
          you specify the CSS property and value to be applied to that selector.

      <h3 class="concept-title">Avoiding Repetition</h3>
      <div class="concept-description line-height">
        <p>
          Avoiding repetition is very important in programming because it helps
          you avoid making errors and also helps with consistency. The reason is
          when programmers don't avoid repetition, they end up doing the same
          thing over and over again which becomes time consuming.
        </p>
        <p>
          In web deveopment, understanding CSS helps with this because CSS style
          rules can be applied to similar HTML elements grouped together. For
          example, making a change to an element without dilligently making the
          same change everywhere that element is used might cause problems. But
          using CSS, you would make that same change only in the CSS selector used
          for grouping the HTML elements.

      <h3 class="concept-title">Box Sizing</h3>
      <div class="concept-description line-height">
        <p>
          All HTML elements are boxes, and each box has four components: Margin,
          Border, Padding and Content. Because there are so many components to
          each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.
          However, there are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing
          issues.
          </p>
          <ol class="ol-lower-roman">
            <li>
              Set the size in terms of percentages rather than pixels so that the
              box size changes depending on how big the screen is.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set the box-sizing CSS attribute to <span class="highlight-text">
              border-box</span> for every element.
            </li>
          </ol>
        <p>
          Note: Different browsers work slightly differently and sometimes this
          causes different browsers to display the same code differently.

      <h3 class="concept-title">Box Positioning</h3>
      <div class="concept-description line-height">
        <p>
          By default, boxes take up the entire width of a page. So in order to
          posistion boxes, you can use the flexible box attribute
          <span class="highlight-text">flex</span> which provides an efficient way to layout a
          line and distribute space in a box.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is done by adding the rule <em class="highlight-text"><code>display: flex;</code></em>
          to the appropriate CSS which will override the box behavior and let
          boxes appear next to each other.
        </p>

          Always remember that building a webpage is an iterative process of
          coding, testing and refining. Below are a few steps to guide you when
          building any webpage:
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <b>Look for natural boxes.</b><em> Everything on the web is a box.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Look for repeated styles and semantic elements.</b>
              <em>Think about how you can relate everything in terms of HTML elements.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Write your HTML.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Apply styles (from Biggest to smallest elements).</b>
              <em>That is biggest site wide elements to smallest widgets.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Fix Things (and verify).</b> <em>Fix the small things by looking at your
              site on different browsers and resizing windows.</em>
            </li>
