<!-- Comments help other People read and understand code. Other programming

    <h2>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
    <p>
      In this tutorial, we will learn some important concepts:
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          How the Web works and how Users, Computers, Servers, HTTP and the
          Internet all fit together
        </li>
        <li>
          How to use HTML tags to create HTML documents that a browser can display
          as a web page
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3> How the Web Works</h3>
    <p>The web is basically a bunch of computers that communicate with each
    other. For example, when a person goes to a web page like www.google.com
    and request an information, their computer sends an <em>HTTP Request</em>
    to a <em>Server</em>. HTTP stands for <em>HyperText Transfer Protocol</em>
    which is the main protocol of the web. Server is the name of computers
    that host HTML documents. Therefore, the server finds the appropriate HTML
    document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser
    </em> like Internet Explorer, Safari, FireFox or Chrome interprets the
    page and displays it on the user's screen.

   does a good job of explaining.</P>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>HTML Basics</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>. It is made up of <em>
      text content</em> which is "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which is
      "how it looks". HTML documents are the heart of the web and form the
      majority of the content. They also make references to other documents,
      images, videos, and links to other pages on the web.
      <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48724340">
        This video</a> gives a good overview.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div> <!-- Tags and Elements start here -->
    <h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
    <p>HTML markup is made up of tags and content. Content is what goes inside
      the openning and closing tags. Examples of tags are &ltb&gt, &ltem&gt, &lt
      a&gt, and
      &ltimg&gt. When we put any content inside an openning and closing tag, that
       whole structure is what we call an HTML <b>element</b>. For example
       <em>&ltb&gtcontent&lt/b&gt</em> and <em>&ltem&gtcontent&lt/em&gt
       </em> are both HTML elements. <br /> We use HTML tags and elements to
      tell a web browser how to display content on a web page.
     <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/e-48011976/m-48703273">
      This video</a> and

      this video</a> show how HTML tags and elements are used. <br /> <br />
      Note: Always remember to <b>open</b> and <b>close</b> HTML tags
      appropriately else the content inside of them and subsequent contents
      won't display like you wanted them to. That, explains why computers are
      stupid.
      <p>
        <h5>Why Computers are Stupid</h5>
        The truth is computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
        exactly the way you enter them. They are very sensitive to typos and as a
        result, small mistakes by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

          This article</a> explains it better.
      </p>
  </div> <!-- End of Tags and Elements -->
  <div>
    <h3>HTML Attributes</h3>
    Some HTML tags accept additional values called <b>attributes</b>. Attributes
    provide additional information to the browser. For example,
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The anchor tag &lta&gt takes an attribute called <em>href</em> that
          defines a URL to link to. The tag structure below creates a hyper
          link to the <em>href</em> attribute "url" and names it link.<br />
          <b>&lta href="url"&gtlink&lt/a&gt</b>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The &ltimg&gt tag structure <b>&ltimg src="url" alt="text"&gt</b>
          displays the image hosted at the <em>src</em> attribute "url". The url
          can also be a path to a local image file on your computer. If the
          image link is broken and can not be displayed, the <em>alt</em>
          attribute "text" will be displayed on the screen. Remember "text" is
          what you choose to display on screen.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    FYI - Notice the difference between the &lta&gt and &ltimg&gt closing tag.
    You should see that the &ltimg&gt tag doesn't have a closing tag with a
    backlash and the tag name. That is because the &ltimg&gt tag has no content
    inside of it whereas the &lta&gt tag had content which was the word
    <b>link</b>. Any element without the closing tag is called a <b>void</b>
    element.
  </div>

 <div>      <!-- Inline vs Block Elements start here -->
   <h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
   <p> All HTML elements can be categorized into two categories:
    <ol type="a">   <!--Ordered list of Inline vs Block Elements -->
      <li>  <!--sub-title Inline Elements  -->
        <strong>Inline Elements</strong>
        <p>
          Inline elements end a line of text and wrap new text to the next line.
          They can appear within sentences and do not have to appear on a new line
          of their own. For example &ltb&gt, &lti&gt, &ltu&gt, &ltem&gt,
          &ltstrong&gt, &ltsup&gt, &ltsub&gt, &ltbig&gt, &ltsmall&gt, &ltli&gt,
          &ltins&gt, &ltdel&gt, &ltcode&gt, &ltcite&gt, &ltdfn&gt, &ltkbd&gt,
          and &ltvar&gt are all inline elements.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>  <!-- sub-title Block Elements -->
        <strong>Block Elements</strong>
        <p>
         Block elements make an "invisible box" around the content inside of
         them. They appear on the screen as if they have line breaks before and
         after them. For example the &ltp&gt, &lth1&gt, &lth2&gt, &lth3&gt,
         &lth4&gt, &lth5&gt, &lth6&gt, &ltul&gt, &ltol&gt, &ltdl&gt, &ltpre&gt,
         &lthr /&gt, &ltblockquote&gt, and &ltaddress&gt are all block elements.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

      this video</a> explains the difference.<br/>
      <br />
      Note: For a browser to be able to display the less than (<) and greater
      than (>) symbols before and after an HTML tag, you have to use

        html-escape</a> characters.

   <h3>Grouping HTML Elements</h3>
   There are two very important tags that are used to group various other HTML
   tags. They are the <b>&ltspan&gt</b> and <b>&ltdiv&gt</b> tag. The &ltspan&gt
   tag is use for grouping and applying style to inline elements whereas the
   &ltdiv&gt tag is use for grouping and applying style to block elements. Check
   out <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_blocks.htm">
     this tutorial</a> for examples on how to use the &ltspan&gt and &ltdiv&gt tag
 </div>
 <div>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>So far, we have learned about the Web which is compose largely of HTML
    documents. We defined what HTML stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language
    </em> which is the language the browse uses to interpret web pages.
    In one of the video links, we saw the components of the web includes clients
    (computer and browser), the Internet, and Servers. The clients and servers
    interact via something called <em>HyperText Transfer Protocol</em> (HTTP).
    <p>We also learned about HTML tags which are used to tell the web browser
    how to display content in a web page. Most HTML tags consist of an opening
    and a closing tag. But some tags like the &ltimg&gt tag do not have a
    closing tag. Those are called <b>void</b> tags. We also learned that tags
    and their contents form a whole structure called an HTML <b>element</b>,
    and HTML has both inline and block elements. Finally, to group inline and
    block elements, we use the <b>&ltspan&gt</b> and <b>&ltdiv&gt</b> tags
    respectively.</p>

<!--  Code Review anchor tag
Great use of an anchor tag. tip: Anchor tags are very versatile. They can point
to local files, remote websites, places on the current page, ftp file, and even
JavaScript. Because the tag can do so many things it is very sensitive to
syntax. <a href="something.txt">something</> will look for a local file.
<a href="http://something.com">something</> will look for a website.
<a href="#something">something</> will look for an element with the name
"something" on the same page.-->

<!--Code Review - tag escape
Nice note about tags! tip: If you want tags to show as readable text instead of
being treated as code, you have to escape the < and > symbols like this:
< becomes &lt; and > becomes &gt; This will tell the browser to draw them
without parsing them. This page may help:
