# IPND

The files in this repository are notes and projects for the Udacity IPND Nanodegree
All project code have been reviewed and accepted as meets specifications.
Each file contains a well written Comments of what you will learn and the code for
the each project. If you're looking to learn HTML or just want to check out my
code then feel free!   

## Stage0
This stage is the into to HTML, the basic structure, using comments, different
HTML tags, and also using escape characters. There are two files in this folder
  intro.html - which basically introduces us to HyperText Markup Language
  stage0.html - first real HTML project with comments, different tags, and how
                to escape characters.

## Stage1
Stage 1 is a continuation of stage0.html but this time we'll see the magic of
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) used for beautifying HTML files.
<b> Cascading Style Sheets </b>
  - In css you first write a selector - this defines what elements on the page a
   style will apply to. You can select an HTML tag and that rule will apply to
   all of that tag in the page
check out https://css-tricks.com/how-css-selectors-work/ for better explanation
of selectors.
  - Also in CSS a class selector starts with a dot (.) followed my the HTML
  class attribute value.
  - An id selector starts with a # sign followed by the HTML ID attribute value.

Thanks for checking out my code. I hope it inspires you to start your web dev't
journey. I use these notes to teach web development to beginner level students.
